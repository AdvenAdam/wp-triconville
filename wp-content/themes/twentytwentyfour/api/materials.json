          "description": "Our teak is kiln dried to a moisture content of 12%. Once dry, the timber can still absorb moisture, which causes ‘movement’. Timber will naturally expand and contract with changes in temperature and humidity. Outdoors this is more extreme than indoors. This is why outdoor furniture traditionally has slats rather than wide boards. Although we design our furniture to minimize and accommodate timber movement as much as possible, it cannot be prevented entirely. If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a dry garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause excessive ‘movement’ and result in splits.",

The one key element they all share is a certain minimum percentage of chromium of 10.5%. Although other elements, particularly nickel and molybdenum, are added to improve corrosion resistance, chromium is always the deciding factor. However, despite its various additions, stainless steel still behaves much the same as steel, and even the highly alloyed stainless steel grades (such as 316) still contain a minimum of 62% iron.",
